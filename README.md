The ultimate goal of practising Continuous Delivery is to enhance the delivery flow. In general, CD:

-	Improve the efficiency of a company.

To understand how CD can be a powerful tool, the organization should be able to understand briefly it works.

## Continuous Delivery 
Continuous Delivery is an approach in which all changes are delivered quickly, safely, and sustainably. It provides an automated high-speed building and testing environment, which aims to release changes reliably at any time. 


## Continuous Integration:

if something takes a lot of time and energy, you should do it more often, forcing you to make it less painful. 

CI is the practice of automating the integration of code changes into a mainline codebase (trunk). Developers merge code changes into a central repository where automated tests are run both before and after the merge, which ensures that the changes do not introduce bugs. 

To successfully implement CI, the minimum requirements are: 

-	The practice of trunk-based development: developers divide their work into small branches and merge that work into a trunk frequently.
-	An automated build process: CI system should be authoritative so that anyone can use a single command to activate the system.
-	An automated testing process: when they fall, problems are revealed, and when they pass, there is no problem with the system.
-	A CI system that runs the build and automated tests: the status of the work should be visible to the team.
