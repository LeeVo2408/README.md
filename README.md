The ultimate goal of practising Continuous Delivery is to enhance the delivery flow. In general, CD:

-	Improve the efficiency of a company.

To understand how CD can be a powerful tool, the organization should be able to understand briefly it works.

# Continuous Delivery 
Continuous Delivery is an engineering approach in which all changes are delivered quickly, safely, and sustainably. It provides an automated high-speed building and testing environment to ensure changes are relevant. This is achieved by ensuring that code is always in a deployable state with thousands of changes made daily. In short, CD takes the repetitive tasks in the deployment process and lets people solve problems.

Benefits of implementing CD:
-	**Low risk released**: CD identifies and addresses bugs in the earlier stage before they grow into more significant problems later. 
-	**Improve developer performance**: Teams have more time to focus on creating innovation instead of doing repetitive tasks. Developers are more confident when pushing code into production with an automated, reliable testing process.
-	**Deliver updates faster**: Organizations can deliver updates to customers quickly and frequently.

There are some minimum practices required, and one of them can be mentioned is [Continuous Integration](https://github.com/LeeVo2408/README.md/blob/main/README.md#continuous-integration) 

# Continuous Integration:

>if something takes a lot of time and energy, you should do it more often, forcing you to make it less painful. 

CI is the practice of automating the integration of code changes into a mainline codebase (trunk). Developers merge code changes into a central repository where automated tests are run both before and after the merge, which ensures that the changes do not introduce bugs. 

To successfully implement CI, the minimum requirements are: 

-	**trunk-based development**: developers divide their work into small branches and merge that work into a trunk frequently.
-	**Continually**: automated testing process
-	**visability**: the status of the work should be visible to the team.
